# Difficulty-and-AI
EU4 mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2053238435

This mod changes Difficulty bonuses AI gets on Hard and Very Hard. Generally bonuses are halved, instead AI is more aggressive on higher difficulty.
AI logic is improved. AI is better at building Economy, picking Advisers, Policies and Ideas. Using Multiplayer meta as reference point.

Because the difference with base game AI is so substantial at this point, it inevitable started affecting balance. So I'm trying to keep the game as fun as possible, without compromising original goal to make AI better.

AI Dept spiral is fixed, at least everything I can spot that is not merc related. Keep in mind that AI can take 3 loans with 1 interest interaction via estates.

Incompatible with mods that change Ideas, Building, Policies. To do most of the AI changes I have to edit base files.

Other changes:
- Added 10 Idea slots in a balanced way.
- Tweaks to ideas and policies, to make more idea groups relevant.
- Rebalanced the amount of discipline in the game.
- More meaningful advisers.
- Added Development click, it works both for Players and AI. Prevents AI from wasting monarch points. Big thanks to LoStack for implementing it. (https://github.com/stackpoint/Dev-Click)
- Effect of corruption was reduced to 1/5 of original game values, and AI is less willing to use debase currency.
- Restricting AI army movements a bit, AI should behave more defensively.   
- Increased base supply limit by 2, AI tends to have more troops with this mod.
- Light tweaks to Basic Government reforms.
- Made Nomad life a bit easier, every Horde can now use banners, tied to culture just like Manchu. Increased Horde unity gain from looting.
- Adds leaders without upkeep from various sources.
- More aggressive AI logic for new Estates, the bottom line for AI is 20% crown land.
