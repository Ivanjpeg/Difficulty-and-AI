# Difficulty-and-AI
EU4 mod. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2053238435

Overview: 
This mod changes Difficulty bonuses AI gets on Hard and Very Hard. Generally bonuses are halved, instead Difficulty Ramps up over the course of the game. AI logic is improved in every aspect of the game. Using Multiplayer meta as a reference point.

Because the difference with base game AI is so substantial at this point, it inevitably started affecting balance. So I'm trying to keep the game as fun as possible, without compromising the original goal to make AI better.

On Normal difficulty the game will feel similar to vanilla but harder, on Very Hard difficulty the game escalates over time and looks like a player game. I'm recommending Very Hard if you are looking for a challenge, or if it's a Coop game.

Updated for 1.30.3
