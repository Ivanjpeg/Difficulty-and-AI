NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_RETURN_CORE = 0.5 -- 0.8 in vanilla. returning a core should be significantly cheaper than demanding the concession of a random province.
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_REVOKE_CORE = 0.25 -- 0.4 in vanilla. set to half of returning a core.
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_RELEASE_ANNEXED = 0.6 -- 0.8 in vanilla. releasing should be cheaper than demanding the concession of the province.
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_RELEASE_VASSAL = 0.3 -- 0.4 in vanilla. set to half of releasing annexed
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_CONVERSION = 0.3 -- 0.8 in vanilla. conversion should definitely be a lot cheaper than demanding full annexation.
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_ENFORCED_FLEET_BASING_RIGHTS = 10 -- 25 in vanilla. the victor still has to pay for it lol
NDefines.NDiplomacy.PEACE_COST_ENFORCED_MILITARY_ACCESS = 5 -- 15 in vanilla. it is difficult to think of a situation where this would be preferable as an option to money or anything else really
